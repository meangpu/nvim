# kickstart.nvim

I try using this again on 2024 base on this video
- [The Only Video You Need to Get Started with Neovim - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8C0Cq9Uv9o)
- [How I Setup Neovim To Make It AMAZING in 2024: The Ultimate Guide - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAG3BHurdM)


## setup requirement
- need to install the Powershell from here to work [PowerShell/PowerShell: PowerShell for every system!](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
- to update package use :Mason
- :Lazy
- :checkhealth
- add `C:\Windows\System32` to path to make cmd.exe work


## note to myself

read this for vscode https://galenwong.github.io/blog/2021-03-22-vscode-neovim-vs-vscodevim/


plugin to install
- `Trouble` = show all trouble like vscode 
- `obsidian` = may be use this with obsidian? but nvim not support thai, so not much prior



TODO:

my shortcut
- QQ is quit
- WW is update / save
