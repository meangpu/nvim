# kickstart.nvim

I try using this again on 2024 base on this video
[The Only Video You Need to Get Started with Neovim - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8C0Cq9Uv9o)


## note to myself

- to get back one folder use 
    - :e .
    - :Explore
- split terminal
    - ctrl+w s = horizontal
    - ctrl+w v = vertical
    - use :vertical res +20 to change window size


plugin to install
- `Trouble` = show all trouble like vscode 
- `obsidian` = may be use this with obsidian? but nvim not support thai, so not much prior
